# MyReads Project

This project is part of the Udacity Front-End NanoDegree program. The goal was to take a barebones "myReads" app and allow for the user to add books with search, change the "shelf" the books were on, and move books between shelves.

# How to Run

1) Clone the app using: https://github.com/MNWild46/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git
2) To install dependencies run: 
        ```npm install``` 

3) Run ```npm start``` to begin the server instance.

# Technologies Used in Build:
1) Nodejs (to launch server)
2) Reactjs (coding + app framework)
3) create-react-app (to initialize the app process + backend elements)
4) Udacity API (for book information and covers)
